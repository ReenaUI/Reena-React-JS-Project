                             <p>The Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) regime is a regime for the taxation of PIE managed funds. The PIE's income is attributed to its investors, based on their shares of the PIE, and is taxed at each investor's Prescribed Investor Rate (PIR). The PIE regime creates tax advantages for some investors, mainly because the maximum PIR is 28%. The regime therefore provides tax benefits to investors who are on a 30% or 33% marginal tax rate and invest in a PIE.</p>
                             <h2>What is a Prescribed Investor Rate (PIR)?</h2>
                             <p>A PIR is the tax rate used to calculate tax on taxable income. Each investor, whether an individual, company, trustee, registered charity or superannuation fund, has a PIR which you must supply at the time of investment. In order to work out which rate applies to you please contact the IRD   <ListGroup.Item><a href="#" class="color-mint" target="_blank">www.ird.govt.nz</a></ListGroup.Item>PIR rates can be changed in the Profile Details area of the platform.</p>
                             <h2>How do I get a tax certificate?</h2>
                             <p>A tax statement will be sent to all investors following the financial year end at 31 March. If you are due a rebate, we will liaise with the IRD on your behalf and will purchase additional units in the fund with the proceeds. If you owe money to the IRD we will deduct units from your holding to pay the IRD.</p>
